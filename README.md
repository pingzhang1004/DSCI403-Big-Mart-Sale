#### 1. Utilized the Seaborn library of Python to visualize the exploration of data  and bivariate analysis.
#### 2. Used advanced data cleaning and feature engineering techniques to handle duplicated records, missing values, and distorted data distributions.
#### 3. Employed the Machine Learning Scikit-learn library to perform model selection and grid search with cross-validation, optimizing the parameters and refining the model.
#### 4. Evaluated five different regression models using mean squared error and identified key features influencing sales by analyzing the model coefficients.
